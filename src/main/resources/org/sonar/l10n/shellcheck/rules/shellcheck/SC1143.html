<p>This backslash is part of a comment and does not continue the line.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sed \
  -e &quot;s/HOST/$HOSTNAME/g&quot;   \
# -e &quot;s/USER/$USER/g&quot;       \
  -e &quot;s/ARCH/$(uname -m)/g&quot; \
  &quot;$buildfile&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sed \
  -e &quot;s/HOST/$HOSTNAME/g&quot;   \
  -e &quot;s/ARCH/$(uname -m)/g&quot; \
  &quot;$buildfile&quot;

# This comment is moved out:
# -e &quot;s/USER/$USER/g&quot;       \
</code></pre>
<p>or using backticked, inlined comments:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sed \
  -e &quot;s/HOST/$HOSTNAME/g&quot;   \
`# -e &quot;s/USER/$USER/g&quot;`     \
  -e &quot;s/ARCH/$(uname -m)/g&quot; \
  &quot;$buildfile&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>(ShellCheck recognizes this idiom and does not suggest quotes or <code>$()</code>, neither of which would have worked)</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck found a line continuation followed by a commented line that appears to try to do the same.</p>
<p>Backslash line continuations are not respected in comments, and the line instead simply terminates. This is a problem when commenting out one line in a multi-line command like the example.</p>
<p>Instead, either move the line away from its statement, or use an <code>`# inline comment`</code> in an unquoted backtick command substitution.</p>
