<p>read without -r will mangle backslashes</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo &quot;Enter name:&quot;
read name
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo &quot;Enter name:&quot;
read -r name
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>By default, <code>read</code> will interpret backslashes before spaces and line feeds (i.e. you can use backslashes in your string as an escape character). This is rarely expected or desired.</p>
<p>Normally you just want to read data <em>including backslashes</em> which are part of the input string and have no special escape meaning, which is what <code>read -r</code> does. You should always use <code>-r</code> unless you have a good reason not to:</p>
<blockquote><p>-r</p>
<p>If this option is given, backslash does not act as an escape character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that <a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/internal.html#READR"><code>read -r</code></a> will still strip leading and trailing spaces. <code>IFS="" read -r</code> prevents this.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you want backslashes to affect field splitting and line terminators instead of being read, you can disable this message with a [[directive]].</p>
