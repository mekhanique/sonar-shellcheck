<p>This variable is assigned to itself, so the assignment does nothing.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">var=&quot;$var&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"># If the goal is to do nothing
true
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck found a variable that is assigned to itself, e.g. <code>x=$x</code>. This obviously has no effect.</p>
<p>Double check what the assignment was supposed to do.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>None.</p>
