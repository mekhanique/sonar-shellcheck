<p>$0 can't be assigned in Dash. This becomes a command name.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">#!/bin/dash
$0=myname
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<p><code>$0</code> can not be changed in Dash.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>You appear to be trying to assign a new value to <code>$0</code> in Dash.</p>
<p>Dash does not support this. Write around it, or switch to Bash.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you instead wanted to compare the value of <code>$0</code>, use a comparison like <code>[ "$0" = "myname" ]</code>.</p>
