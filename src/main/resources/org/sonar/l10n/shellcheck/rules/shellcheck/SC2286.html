<p>This empty string is interpreted as a command name. Double check syntax (or use 'true' as a no-op).</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">jq 
   &#39;&#39;
   file.json
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">jq \
  &#39;&#39; \
  file.json
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck found an empty string used as a command name. This is never valid.</p>
<p>If the command is intended to do nothing, use <code>true</code> aka <code>:</code> instead. Otherwise, determine why an empty string ended up as a command name and fix it accordingly. In the example, each line was interpreted as a separate command due to missing line continuations.</p>
