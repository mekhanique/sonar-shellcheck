<p>This is interpreted as a command name ending with '/'. Double check syntax.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">df/
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">df /
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck found a command name that ends with <code>/</code>. Since directories are not valid commands, this is always wrong.</p>
<p>The most common reason is bad quoting or escaping, such as in the example where a space was missing between a command and its argument.</p>
