<p>Prefer [[ ]] over [ ] for tests in Bash/Ksh.</p>
<p>This is an [[optional]] suggestion. It must be explicitly enabled with a [[directive]] <code>enable=require-double-brackets</code> in a <code># shellcheck</code> comment or <code>.shellcheckrc</code></p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">[ -e /etc/issue ]
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">[[ -e /etc/issue ]]
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck has been explicitly asked to warn about uses of <code>[ .. ]</code> in favor of the extended Bash/Ksh test <code>[[ .. ]]</code>.</p>
<p><code>[[ .. ]]</code> suppresses word splitting and globbing, supports a wider variety of tests, and is generally safer and better defined than <code>[ .. ]</code>. For an in-depth list of differences, see the Related Resources.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>This check is not enabled by default, and may have been turned on for your current project by someone who wants it enforced. You can still [[ignore]] it with a directive.</p>
<p>This suggestion does not trigger for Sh or Dash scripts, even when explicitly enabled, as these shells don't support <code>[[ .. ]]</code>.</p>
