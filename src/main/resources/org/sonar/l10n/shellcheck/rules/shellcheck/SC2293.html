<p>When eval'ing @Q-quoted words, use * rather than @ as the index.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">eval &quot;$MYCOMMAND ${@@Q}&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">eval &quot;$MYCOMMAND ${*@Q}&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck noticed that you are calling <code>eval</code> and including an escaped array. However, the array is passed as multiple arguments and relies on being implicitly joined together to form a single shell string, which <code>eval</code> can then evaluate.</p>
<p>Instead, prefer building your shell string with explicit string concatenation by using <code>*</code> instead of <code>@</code> for the index, such as <code>${*@Q}</code> or <code>${array[*]@Q}</code>.</p>
<p>This suggestion is equivalent to [[SC2124]], but for <code>eval</code> arguments rather than string variables.</p>
