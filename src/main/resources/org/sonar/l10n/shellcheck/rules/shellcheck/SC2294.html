<p>eval negates the benefit of arrays. Drop eval to preserve whitespace/symbols (or eval as string).</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">check() {
  eval &quot;$@&quot; || exit
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">check() {
  &quot;$@&quot; || exit
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck found <code>eval</code> used on an array (or equivalently, <code>"$@"</code>). This is problematic because it effectively throws away all boundary information and rebuilds it from shell words.</p>
<p>Let's say you invoke <code>check sed -i '$d' "my file.txt"</code>:</p>
<p><code>eval "$@"</code> will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Join the elements on spaces: <code>sed -i $d my file.txt</code></li>
<li>Split the string on shell word boundaries: <code>sed</code>, <code>-i</code>, <code>$d</code>, <code>my</code> <code>file.txt</code></li>
<li>Perform shell expansions (assuming <code>$d</code> is unset): <code>sed</code>, <code>-i</code>, <code>my</code>, <code>file.txt</code></li>
<li>Execute the first element as the command and the rest as its arguments, as if running <code>sed -i 'my' 'file.txt'</code></li>
</ol>
<p><code>"$@"</code> will</p>
<ol>
<li>Execute the first element as the command and the rest as its arguments, as if running <code>sed -i '$d' 'my file.txt'</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that while <code>"$@"</code> is essentially always better than <code>eval "$@"</code>, it's easy to unintentionally introduce a dependency on bad behavior through the shell debugging anti-strategy of "adding quotes until it works":</p>
<pre><code># Works with problematic example because of double-escaping, fails with correct example
check ls -l "'My File.txt'" 

# Works with correct example the way it was always intended:
check ls -l "My File.txt"
</code></pre>
<p>The correct example is still better, but the function invocation has to be tweaked as well.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If each of the array elements is a carefully escaped shell command or word, use <code>*</code> instead of <code>@</code> to explicitly join the elements on spaces which is what would happen anyways:</p>
<pre><code>on_exit=(
  'rm /tmp/myfile; '
  'echo "Finished on $(date)" &gt; log.txt; '
)

# Equivalent to `eval "${on_exit[@]}"`, but more explicit
eval "${on_exit[*]}"

# Even better in this case, as it does not require
# semicolons and commands don't interfere:
for cmd in "${on_exit[@]}"
do
  eval "$cmd"
done
</code></pre>
<p>If you require <code>eval</code> for another part of the command, explicitly transform the array into a series of escaped shell words. This ensures that the array elements will <code>eval</code> back to themselves:</p>
<pre><code># Assumed to be outside of our control, 
# otherwise we would doput this in an array as well:
COMMAND='dialog --menu "Choose file:" 15 40 4'

# Our array:
array=(
  1 "My File.txt"
  2 "My Other File.txt"
)
eval "$COMMAND ${array[*]@Q}"                     # Bash 4+
eval "$COMMAND $(printf "%q " "${array[@]}")"     # Bash 1+
</code></pre>
