<p>In POSIX sh, set option pipefail is undefined.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">#!/bin/sh
set -o pipefail
if cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3
then
  echo &quot;Success&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">fail=&quot;$(mktemp)&quot;
if { cmd1 || echo &gt; &quot;$fail&quot;; } |
   { cmd2 || echo &gt; &quot;$fail&quot;; } |
     cmd3 &amp;&amp; [ ! -s &quot;$fail&quot; ]
then
  echo &quot;Success&quot;
fi
rm &quot;$fail&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>or switch to a shell that supports pipefail, such as Bash.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck found <code>set -o pipefail</code> in a script declare to run with <code>sh</code> or <code>dash</code>. This feature may not be supported on these shells.</p>
<p>As an alternative, each stage in the pipeline such as <code>cmd1</code> can be rewritten as <code>{ cmd1 || echo &gt; file; }</code> which will behave as before but now also write the exit code into <code>file</code> if the command fails.</p>
<p>If the file has been written to when the pipeline is done, it means one of the commands failed. This is demonstrated in the correct example.</p>
<p>This can obviously be extended with e.g. <code>echo "cmd1=$?" &gt;&gt; file</code> if the particular exit codes for particular commands are desired.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If the script has already inspected the current shell and determined the option is available, you can [[ignore]] this message.</p>
